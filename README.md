## Presentation Rubric:
    - 15-minute presentation in week 14
    - Expectations
        - Brief introduction of background settings of the problem (2 min)
    - A clear statement of the research question (1 min)
    - Motivating the question (3 min): Why should we care? What do we gain from your work?
    - Statistical analysis to answer the question you raise (8 min Explain your analysis carefully
    - Add data visualization
    - Graphic aids
    - Make this pretty
    - Conclusion/Takeaway (1 min): What should we learn and remember from your work?
    
## Content Rubric:
    - Slides of the presentation, including a detailed appendix summarizing research methods and finding should also be submitted by Week 14
    - Evaluation: 20% by the instructor, 5% by within-group peer evaluation, and 5% by cross-group evaluation.
        - Within-group: Rate each of your teammates
        - Cross-group: Rate the work of other groups according to their presentation
        - Please be honest and fair. Act with academic integrity
    - Criterion: 
        1. Interestingness/significance of research question 
        2. Rigor of analysis 
        3. Quality of delivery
        
## Scope: 
    - There is no scope
        - Tools for analysis are not limited to what we have learned in class. However, it is not your responsibility to explain them (assuming we know nothing), if you use techniques not discussed in class
        - Also , feel free to supplement your analysis with data from other sources. However, the main analysis should be focused on the dataset provided by the instructor. It is allowed and encouraged to supplement, but not substitute.
    - Reproducibility of results: 
        - All results should be reproducible. 
        - All code used for analysis should be submitted along with the paper. 
        
## Useful Resources:
    - Python for cryptocurrency analysis
    - Predicting Bitcoin Price with News in Python
    
## Data Sources:
    - BUSF-SHU Bitcoin Dataset
    - Historical Crypto Price Data (Yahoo Finance)
    - Google Trends Data

## Research Questions:
    - Are the outliers really invalid?
        - Just check them 
    - Geographic distribution of Bitcoin mining
        - A bit difficult
        - Can only determine correlation and not causation
    - Correlation with stocks
        - Which non-tech stock is most strongly correlated with the price of Bitcoin
        - And why?
    - Most hyped crypto
        - Use Google Trends
    
## Statistical Analysis Techniques
    - Regression
        - Literally a best fit line
        - What does an increase x tell about y 
    - Hypothesis testing
    - T-tests
